# RAG: Document Processing and Query System

Factor-RAG is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents, generate embeddings from the text, and query the document using natural language questions. The backend processes the PDF files and generates embeddings using a model, and the frontend provides an interactive interface for users to upload files and query the document.

## Overview

The **Factor-RAG** system works by allowing users to upload PDF documents to the backend, which processes the files to extract text and generate embeddings. These embeddings are then used to answer user queries about the document. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to upload files, ask questions, and display AI-generated answers.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files which are processed for text and embeddings.
- **Query Interface**: Users can ask questions about the content of the uploaded document and receive AI-generated answers.
- **Embeddings-Based Search**: The backend processes the text into embeddings and efficiently searches through these embeddings to provide relevant answers.
- **Frontend & Backend Integration**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+** (for backend)
- **Node.js** (for frontend)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **npm** (Node.js package manager)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talibilat/rags.git
cd rags
```

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Export your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

### Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

The backend uses a configuration file (`config.yaml`) where you can set parameters for the model, chunk size, and the number of top results to return for each query.

Example of `backend/config.yaml`:
```yaml
model: 'gpt-4o'
chunk_size: 5
top_k: 3
```

- **model**: The AI model to use for embedding and querying (e.g., GPT-4).
- **chunk_size**: The size of the chunks into which the PDF text is divided.
- **top_k**: Number of top results to return for each query.

Make sure the **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** is exported in your environment before running the backend.

## Running the Application

### Running the Backend

1. After configuring the backend and installing dependencies, start the FastAPI backend by running the following in the `backend/` directory:
   
   
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the backend server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running the Frontend

1. In a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the `frontend/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Full Workflow

1. **Upload a PDF**: Navigate to the frontend (`http://localhost:3000`) and use the "Upload New File" button to upload a PDF document. Once uploaded, the backend will process the document and generate embeddings.
   
2. **Ask Questions**: After the PDF is processed, you can type questions in the query input box and press "Send". The system will use the embeddings to find relevant answers from the uploaded document and display them in the chatbox.
